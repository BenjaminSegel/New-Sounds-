            This week, we're welcoming back none other than the Sugababes
            tonight, who are releasing their first proper single together since
            2013 in When The Rain Comes. We got a taste of the brilliance they
            were cooking up in 2013 as MKS when the Lost Tapes dropped last
            year, but hopefully this new track will signal lots of new music to
            come from a trio who are still regarded as the high mark for British
            female pop groups.

            This week, a new podcast, drawing from the hours of recorded audio by the two men Paul
            McCartney and Paul Muldoon. McCartney: A Life in Lyrics will feature
            24 episodes across two seasons, each focusing on a different song.
            Among the tracks tackled in the first season will be “Eleanor
            Rigby,” “Back in the U.S.S.R.,” and “Live and Let Die.”
